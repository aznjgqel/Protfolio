## Project #1 Depression and Commuting time to work 

This project utilized cross-sectional data from American Community Survey and National Longitudinal Survey of Youth with geographic information to examine the relationship between commuting time to work and depression. I applied Spatial lag regression to analyze the merged data with QGIS and R, and concluded that longer commuting time to work is associated with longer days of feeling depressive.

## Project #2 Airbnb in New York

This project utilized GIS spatial analysis method and tools such as QGIS, R to investigate the relationship between price of Airbnb rentals and spatial distribution attributes (rental locations, subway station density and etc.)of 5 boroughs in New York. In addition, I visualized the heatmap of Airbnb prices and correlations between difference predictors.
